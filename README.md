Hello anyone checking out this resource! There are some simple things about this resource that I'll list out below.

1. While this resource can be opened as a Standalone resource, it is currently geared for a QBCore framework in a lot of ways
2. All files are open source and you are free to do as you please to anything in this file
3. If you change the name of the resource, you'll need to update line 34 in the app.js file to your new resource name
4. Be prepared to see the word "clit" a lot, I used this resource to fuel my RP endeavors on a server that I no longer work on
5. Be prepared for awful artwork and overall design, this is meant to be a simple resource that can fuel other resources
6. The Racing App has a dependency for Rahe-Racing which can be found here (https://rahe.tebex.io/package/5077040). You can also change the dependency to any other racing resource you have by changing line 21 in client.lua to your resource's event. This App also requires a USB item that is purchased from a hidden shop.
7. The Carboosting app has a dependency for Lionh34rt's resource which can be found here (https://lionh34rt.tebex.io/package/4982932). Everything that applied above to the racing app also applies here.
8. USB item images I used will be in the QBCore folder along with the code required to add the items to your framework, etc.
9. Hidden shop logic is within the client.lua from lines 55 through 127. I used this to distribute the USB's along with some other illegal items we had in the server. Simply create a new shop in your frameworks shop resource(I used qb-shops). The logic in here just transports you to the shop locations, you can find the coords for the "elevators" in the config.lua

If you've read all of that, here is what this resource currently offers

1. Experience App - Track all of your job experience in one place, legal or illegal.
2. Racing App - Get sweaty and try hard with the boys and grills.
3. Carboosting - Break the law and have some fun doing it too! The higher up the chain you go, the harder it gets.
4. Ability to have your own unique desktop background! Can be changed in your laptop's settings.
5. Elevator logic for hidden shops
6. Might find a drone resource in the near future to plug and play into the logic that I never finished, if you've got something and want to plug it in go for it! Follow the format I used for the racing and carboosting app and it'll work.
